# New Luau

A standalone scripting language based on [Luau](https://github.com/luau-lang/luau), built to feel **100% identical to Roblox LuaU** — including familiar APIs like `Instance`, `Workspace`, and events — but free to use **outside of Roblox**.  

This project’s goal is to give developers the **same smooth LuaU experience** anywhere:  
- Standalone games  
- Custom game engines  
- General-purpose scripting  

## Goals

- **Identical syntax & behavior to Roblox LuaU**  
- **Core Roblox-style APIs available everywhere**  
  - `Instance.new`, `Workspace`, `Players`, `Touched`, etc.  
- **Portable runtime**: run `.luau` files on Windows, Mac, Linux  
- **Beginner-friendly**: keep the same flow as Roblox scripting

## Usage

Clone and build the project (requires CMake + a C++ compiler)
